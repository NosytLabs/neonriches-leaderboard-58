                    SpendThrone is a <strong>satirical</strong> social platform that parodies and comments on consumer culture, materialism, and status-seeking behavior. All transactions are real, but the prestige is as hollow as a chocolate crown.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-white/70">
                    By participating, you acknowledge that you understand the satirical nature of this service and that your purchases are effectively donations to a piece of performance art about wealth and status.

                    All payments to SpendThrone are <strong>FINAL and NON-REFUNDABLE</strong>. When you pay for rank, you're buying just that: pixels on a screen showing how much money you've spent. No refunds will be provided, regardless of whether you experience buyer's remorse or suddenly realize the existential implications of your purchase.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-white/70">
                    You acknowledge that the digital status you purchase has no real-world value beyond what importance you and others arbitrarily assign to it, much like designer logos, limited edition sneakers, and luxury water bottles.

                  <p className="text-white/70">
                    While we celebrate the absurdity of status-seeking, we do not tolerate harassment, hate speech, or illegal content. Your profile, comments, and interactions must comply with basic human decency.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-white/70">
                    SpendThrone reserves the right to remove content and ban users who violate these terms, even if they've paid thousands for their rank. Money can't buy you immunity from the rules, just like it can't buy happiness (though it can buy a pretty convincing facsimile).

                    SpendThrone may modify these terms at any time. We'll notify users of significant changes, but it's your responsibility to check for updates. Continued use of SpendThrone after changes indicates your acceptance of the new terms.

                  <p className="text-white/70">
                    You acknowledge that SpendThrone is an evolving platform and that features, visuals, and functionality may change. The only constant is that your rank will always be determined by how much you've spent. That's our golden rule.

                SpendThrone collects minimal user information necessary to maintain your account and rank. We don't sell your data because, frankly, your willingness to pay for digital status is all we're interested in.

              <p>
                We use standard security measures to protect your information, but no system is perfectly secure. Your SpendThrone rank, however, is secured by blockchain technology, making it as immutable as your decision to spend money on digital prestige.
