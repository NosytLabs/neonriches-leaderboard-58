        '• Harass others (shade must be artful, not harmful)',
        '• Submit false information (your actual bank balance is sad enough)',
        '• Interfere with the service (our developers are fragile)',
        '• Use the service for unauthorized commercial purposes (that\'s our job)',

        '• Service interruptions (even royal servers need naps)',
        '• Viruses (we don\'t control what lurks in the digital moat)',
