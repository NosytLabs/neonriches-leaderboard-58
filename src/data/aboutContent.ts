      title: 'Our Concept',
      content: [
        'SpendThrone is a satirical social experiment that explores the dynamics of wealth, status, and digital prestige. Our platform fearlessly examines how monetary contributions can translate into social standing, creating a transparent "pay-to-win" environment that reflects and amplifies the economic hierarchies often obscured in other digital spaces.',
        'Founded in 2023, SpendThrone was created as a deliberate exaggeration of existing social platforms where money often quietly determines visibility and influence. By making this relationship explicit, we invite users to reflect on the nature of digital status while participating in a uniquely honest ecosystem.',
        'Our platform operates on a simple premise: $1 spent equals 1 unit of rank. The leaderboard never resets, creating a permanent record of contribution and status.'

      title: 'Our Philosophy',
      content: [
        'SpendThrone embraces a philosophy of transparent satire. We believe that by creating an overtly "pay-to-win" system, we can spark meaningful conversations about the role of money in determining social value and digital presence.',
        'We operate with a wink and a nod, acknowledging the absurdity of our premise while recognizing how it mirrors aspects of digital and physical society that often go unacknowledged. Our approach is not cynical, but rather an invitation to engage with these realities through humor and self-awareness.',
        'Every feature of SpendThrone—from our RGB Teams to our Mockery Festival—is designed to blend entertainment with social commentary, creating an experience that is simultaneously fun and thought-provoking.'

      title: 'The Team',
      content: [
        'SpendThrone was created by a collective of digital artists, developers, and social commentators who became fascinated by the intersection of wealth and status in online spaces.',
        'Our team brings diverse backgrounds in game design, behavioral economics, and digital anthropology, unified by a shared interest in how financial resources shape online interactions and communities.',
        'We work remotely across multiple time zones, connected by our commitment to creating a platform that is both entertaining and illuminating.'

        'SpendThrone's mission is to create a transparent digital economy that serves as both entertainment and social commentary.',

        '• Provide a unique social platform where the rules are clear and consistent',

        '• Foster a community that engages thoughtfully with questions of wealth, status, and digital existence',
