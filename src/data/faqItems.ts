    question: "What is SpendThrone?",
    answer: "SpendThrone is a satirical social experiment that explores the dynamics of wealth, status, and competition. It's a web platform where your rank is determined solely by how much money you spend. Think of it as pay-to-win, but with complete self-awareness and a hint of social commentary."

    question: "How does the ranking system work?",
    answer: "Our ranking system is beautifully simple: $1 spent equals 1 unit of rank. The more you spend, the higher you climb. The leaderboard never resets, so your financial commitments to digital prestige are preserved for eternity (or until our servers go down)."
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "Is this serious?",
    answer: "Yes and no. We're seriously building a platform that lets people pay for status, but we're doing it with a satirical edge that pokes fun at the very concept. Think of it as performance art that comments on capitalism, social media validation, and status anxiety."

    id: "4",
    question: "What do I get for my money?",
    answer: "Digital prestige, bragging rights, and a customizable profile that becomes more enhanced the more you spend. You'll also get access to exclusive features like profile boosts, mockery actions against lower-ranked users, and team competitions. Your contributions also help us continue developing this unique social experiment."

    question: "Can I withdraw my money?",
    answer: "In general, no. Once you've exchanged real currency for digital status, there's no going back. However, Royal tier users do have limited withdrawal options via Solana. Remember: this is primarily about showcasing our human willingness to pay for intangible status, not an investment platform."

    question: "Is this legal?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We're transparently offering digital services in exchange for payment. We don't promise any financial returns, and we're very upfront about the satirical nature of our platform. We comply with all relevant regulations for digital services."

    question: "What are Teams?",
    answer: "Teams (Red, Green, and Blue) are collective groups you can join to compete for team dominance. Your individual spending contributes to your team's total, and the highest-spending team gets special perks and bragging rights. It's like political tribalism, but more honest about the money involved!"

    id: "8",
    question: "What is Mockery?",
    answer: "Mockery is our system that lets higher-ranked users spend money to apply humiliating effects to lower-ranked profiles. From virtual tomatoes to public stocks, it's all about asserting dominance through digital shame. Don't worry - targeted users can purchase 'Protection' to remove these effects."

    id: "9",
    question: "How do Profile Boosts work?",
    answer: "Profile Boosts are premium visual enhancements that make your profile stand out. From animated backgrounds to special effects, these temporary boosts signal your commitment to digital excess. Different tiers (Basic, Premium, Royal) offer increasingly ostentatious visual effects."

    question: "Is my payment information secure?",
    answer: "Yes, we take security seriously. We use industry-standard payment processors and never store your full payment details on our servers. All transactions are processed through secure, encrypted connections."
