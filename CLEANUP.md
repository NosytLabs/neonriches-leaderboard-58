## Style Cleanup (2023-09-15)

### Changes Made:
1. Removed duplicate floating-coins.css file
2. Created unified-theme.css to consolidate royal theme styles
3. Created consolidated-animations.css to reduce animation duplication
4. Updated index.css to reference the new consolidated files

### Benefits:
- Reduced CSS duplication
- Single source of truth for animations and theme styles
- Better organized styles for maintainability
- Smaller overall CSS bundle size

### Next Steps:
1. Consider further refactoring App.css (437 lines) and theme.css (382 lines)
2. Implement better organization for utility classes
3. Review component-specific styles for potential consolidation

## Style Cleanup (Continued)

### Changes Made:
1. Refactored App.css into:
   - root-variables.css
   - medieval-elements.css
   - marketing-elements.css
   - gold-dust.css

2. Refactored theme.css into:
   - royal-variables.css
   - royal-gradients.css
   - royal-team-colors.css
   - royal-effects.css
   - royal-text.css
   - glass-effects.css
   - rank-badges.css
   - shame-effects.css
   - scrollbar.css
   - index.css (to import all theme files)

### Benefits:
- Improved code organization with smaller, more focused files
- Eliminated duplication with unified-theme.css and consolidated-animations.css
- Better file names that clearly indicate their purpose
- Easier maintenance with logical separation of concerns
- Reduced CSS file sizes

## Type Definitions Cleanup (Current)

### Changes Made:
1. Consolidated duplicate type definitions:
   - Removed duplicate ProfileImage interface from profile.ts
   - Imported shared types from user.ts in profile.ts
   - Ensured consistent type usage across components

2. Improved CSS organization:
   - Restructured style imports in index.css
   - Organized imports by category (core, visual effects, animations)
   - Created clearer separation between utility and feature-specific styles

### Benefits:
- More consistent type system with single source of truth
- Reduced type definition maintenance overhead
- Better organized style system with logical grouping
- Easier to find and update styles
- Reduced potential for CSS conflicts and duplications

### Next Steps:
1. Consider creating a shared "core-types.ts" for truly common types
2. Review component-specific types for potential consolidation
3. Implement style guide for type definitions and CSS organization
4. Add ESLint rules to enforce type consistency
