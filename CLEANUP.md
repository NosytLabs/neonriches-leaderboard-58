## Style Cleanup (2023-09-15)

### Changes Made:
1. Removed duplicate floating-coins.css file
2. Created unified-theme.css to consolidate royal theme styles
3. Created consolidated-animations.css to reduce animation duplication
4. Updated index.css to reference the new consolidated files

### Benefits:
- Reduced CSS duplication
- Single source of truth for animations and theme styles
- Better organized styles for maintainability
- Smaller overall CSS bundle size

### Next Steps:
1. Consider further refactoring App.css (437 lines) and theme.css (382 lines)
2. Implement better organization for utility classes
3. Review component-specific styles for potential consolidation
